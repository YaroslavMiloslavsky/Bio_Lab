# Welcome to my BioLab
 This is a fan project so don't take any of that too serious, although our goal is to get pretty close simulation to the real life processes that are done by a computer
### Installation process
- Ensure that Python version 3.7 or greater is installed
- Install pip 
    - If you are on GNU/Linux use 'sudo apt install python3-pip'
    - If you are on Windows it should already be installed, if not, use google
- (Optional) Install and configure virtual environment:
    - In the terminal execute
    - 'pip install virtualenv'
    - virtualenv [name-of-your-environment]
    - To activate execute 'source [name-of-your-environment]/Scripts/activate
    - To deactivate simply execute 'deactivate'
- Copy the repository with 'git clone https://github.com/YaroslavMiloslavsky/Bio_Lab.git' or just download the ZIP file
- Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' or pip3 if you are using Linux


### Running the file
- WIndows: Get your favorite CLI tool and hit 'python main.py'
- Linux: Same as windows but either 'alias python=python3' and 'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py'

# What is BioLab?
#### Well, this is a biological computation lab or an organic computer if you may. <br> The functionality of the lab is small for now but will continue expand more and more (feel free to contribute)

* Available simulations:
    - Enzymes such as Polymerase and Primase (and more)
    - Polynucleotides with the separate strands
    - DNA replication (including the enzymes in action)
    - More coming soon

# Examples
* *coming soon*
