# Welcome to my BioLab
 This is a fan project so don't take any of that too serious, although our goal is to get pretty close simulation to the real life processes that are done by a computer
### Installation process
- Ensure that Python version 3.7 or greater is installed
- Pretty much all for now


### Running the file
- WIndows: Get your favorite CLI tool and hit 'python main.py'
- Linux: Same as windows but either 'alias python=python3' and 'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py'

# What is BioLab?
#### Well, this is a biological computation lab or an organic computer if you may. <br> The functionality of the lab is small for now but will continue expand more and more (feel free to contribute)

* Available simulations:
    - Enzymes such as Polymerase and Primase (and more)
    - Polynucleotides with the separate strands
    - DNA replication (including the enzymes in action)
    - More coming soon

# Examples
* *coming soon*
